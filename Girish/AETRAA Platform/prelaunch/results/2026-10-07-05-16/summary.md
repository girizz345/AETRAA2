| Backend | ID | Area | Check | Result | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| all | A0 | Boot | release unpacks and installs its packages | FAIL | spawnSync npm ENOENT |
| all | U1 | Untestable here | Sign-in codes by email (Azure Communication Services) | UNTESTABLE | sends real email; needs the live ACS connection string. Check by hand on the live site with one internal address. |
| all | U2 | Untestable here | Scheduled sends: daily 18:00, weekly Mon 07:00, monthly 1st 08:00, 06:00 digest | UNTESTABLE | driven by the server clock and email; the report bodies they send are covered by F1. |
| all | U3 | Untestable here | AI report narrative with a real key | UNTESTABLE | needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and spends money; only the switched-off path is tested (F2). |
| all | U4 | Untestable here | Azure object storage for files | UNTESTABLE | needs the live S3/Blob credentials; locally files go in the database. After deploy, sign in as owner and open /api/storage — it must say working: true. |
| all | U5 | Untestable here | Azure hosting, DNS, TLS for app.aetraa.ae | UNTESTABLE | infrastructure, not code; use --live-readonly after deploy. |
| all | U6 | Untestable here | Installing as a phone app (PWA) | UNTESTABLE | needs a real phone over HTTPS. |
